    <h2 id="section1">Color</h2>
    <p>Brown is a color. It can be considered a composite color, but it is mainly a darker shade of orange. In the CMYK color model used in printing and painting, brown is usually made by combining the colors orange and black.
        <blockquote>
            In the RYB color model, brown is made by mixing the three primary colors, red, yellow, and blue.
        </blockquote>
    According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; it is often associated with fecal matter, plainness, the rustic, although it does also have positive associations, including baking, warmth, wildlife, the autumn and music.</p>

    <h2 id="section2">Shades</h2>
    <p>
        Shades of brown can be produced by combining red, yellow, and black pigments, or by a combination of orange and black—illustrated in the color box. The RGB color model, that generates all colors on computer and television screens, makes brown by combining red and green light at different intensities. Brown color names are often imprecise, and some shades, such as beige, can refer to lighter rather than darker shades of yellow and red. Such colors are less saturated than colors perceived to be orange. Browns are usually described as light or dark, reddish, yellowish, or gray-brown. There are no standardized names for shades of brown; the same shade may have different names on different color lists, and sometimes one name (such as beige or puce) can refer to several very different colors. The X11 color list of web colors has seventeen different shades of brown, but the complete list of browns is much longer.

    <h2 id="section3">Etymology</h2>
    <p>
        The term is from Old English brún, in origin for any dusky or dark shade of color. The first recorded use of brown as a color name in English was in 1000.[8][9] The Common Germanic adjectives *brûnoz and *brûnâ meant both dark colors and a glistening or shining quality, whence burnish. The current meaning developed in Middle English from the 14th century.

    <h2 id="section4">History</h2>
    <p>
        In the Middle Ages brown robes were worn by monks of the Franciscan order, as a sign of their humility and poverty. Each social class was expected to wear a color suitable to their station; and grey and brown were the colors of the poor. Russet was a coarse homespun cloth made of wool and dyed with woad and madder to give it a subdued grey or brown shade. By the statute of 1363, poor English people were required to wear russet. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The 17th and 18th century saw the greatest use of brown. Caravaggio and Rembrandt Van Rijn used browns to create chiaroscuro effects, where the subject appeared out of the darkness. Rembrandt also added umber to the ground layers of his paintings because it promoted faster drying. Rembrandt also began to use new brown pigment, called Cassel earth or Cologne earth. This was a natural earth color composed of over ninety percent organic matter, such as soil and peat. It was used by Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, and later became commonly known as Van Dyck brown.

    <h2 id="section5">Culture</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to brown uniforms, it has been a popular color for military uniforms since the late 18th century, largely because of its wide availability and low visibility. Business wise, Labrecque, et al. (2012) have hypothesized that brown would be related to competence when used in advertising, as the color is typically associated with reliability and support. However, they did not find a link between brown and competence. Brown also is represented in religion. In Wicca, brown represents endurance, solidity, grounding, and strength. It is strongly associated with the element of earth.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section6">In Nature</h2>
    <p>
        The thin top layer of the Earth's crust on land is largely made up of soil colored different shades of brown. Rich and fertile soils tend to be darker in color; the deeper brown color of fertile soil comes from the decomposing of the organic matter. Dead leaves and roots become black or brown as they decay. Poorer soils are usually paler brown in color, and contain less water or organic matter.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section7">In Art</h2>
    <p>
        Brown has been used in art since prehistoric times. Paintings using umber, a natural clay pigment composed of iron oxide and manganese oxide, have been dated to 40,000 BC. Paintings of brown horses and other animals have been found on the walls of the Lascaux cave dating back about 17,300 years. The female figures in ancient Egyptian tomb paintings have brown skin, painted with umber. Light tan was often used on painted Greek amphorae and vases, either as a background for black figures, or the reverse.

    <h2 id="section8">Pigments, dyes, inks</h2>
    <p>
        Raw umber and burnt umber are two of the oldest pigments used by humans. Umber is a brown clay, containing a large amount of iron oxide and between five and twenty percent manganese oxide, which give the color. Its shade varies from a greenish brown to a dark brown. It takes its name from the Italian region of Umbria, where it was formerly mined. The principal source today is the island of Cyprus. Burnt umber is the same pigment which has been roasted (calcined), which turns the pigment darker and more reddish.

    <h2 id="section9">Human Body</h2>
    <p>
        In humans, brown eyes result from a relatively high concentration of melanin in the stroma of the iris, which causes light of both shorter and longer wavelengths to be absorbed and in many parts of the world, it is nearly the only iris color present. Brown is the second most common color of human hair, after black. It is caused by higher levels of the natural dark pigment eumelanin, and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin.

    <h2 id="section10">Coffee</h2>
    <p>
        This is my personal section. The color brown, people either love it or hate it. I love it because the first thing I thought of was iced coffee. I'm fond of iced coffee, but this winter season I've gravitated towards hot drinks more. Coffee's shades of brown ranges pretty drastically, mainly depending on how much milk is added. I never drink black coffee. My favorite way to enjoy it is to add some form of non-dairy milk, no extra sugars/creamer/syrup.
